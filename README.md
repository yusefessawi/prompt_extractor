**Prompt Engineering**: Crafting high-quality prompts that can guide a large language model (LLM) toward generating precise and meaningful responses

**Why prompt theft matters:**
- A good prompt is valuable because it is effective at performing particular tasks, contains sensitive information, or both.
- A prompt is a form of intellectual property that its owners would like to protect, often for competitive advantage is business contexts
- If an adversary reconstructs a prompt, they can use such information to craft other attacks
Guiding question: given an LLM response, can we reconstruct the prompt that generated it?

**Common prompt types:**
- Direct prompts:
    - example: Why do humans have different colored eyes? What causes people to have different colors of eyes? Is there a point to the color of your eyes other than superstitions?
- Role-based prompts:
    - example: I want you to act as an etymologist. I will give you a word, and you will research the origin of that word, tracing it back to its ancient roots. My first request is "I want to trace the origins of the word ’pizza.’"
- In-Context Prompts:
    - example: The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 9, 10, 12, 13, 4, 2. A: Adding all the odd numbers (17, 9, 13) gives 39. The answer is False.  The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. A:
